# World of Xeen (Amiga) — WIP

A clean base for a fan port of Might and Magic IV/V "World of Xeen" to the Amiga. This repository was stripped of the original project's documentation and will be expanded as the port takes shape.

## Purpose

- Establish a minimal starting point for the Amiga port
- Keep docs lightweight until concrete systems are in place

## Project layout

- `src/`: source code
- `include/`: headers
- `assets/`: placeholder assets
- `data/`: data files
- `Tools/`: helper scripts
- `CMakeLists.txt`: build configuration

## Build

TBD. Standard CMake flow is planned once toolchain and targets are finalized.
